## User Experience UX

Website provides them with a means to communicate the details of their vow renewal, capture RSVPs and share content from the first time around.

**Users:**

### Design Choices

- I envisaged that this site would predominantly be used on Mobile. I made the choice to use bootstrap to facilitate my design and I scaled from Mobile first.

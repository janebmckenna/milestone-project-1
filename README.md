## User Experience UX
***
### Strategy
I need to provide an intuitive and informative website for the vow renewal of Hannah and Ashley.

### Customers: Hannah and Ashley
Website provides them with a means to communicate the details of their vow renewal, capture RSVPs and share content from the first time around.

### Users: 
Users are close friends and family of Hannah and Ashley they are interested in their story, viewing their pictures, RSVPing to their invite and the details of the day what to expect and what accomodation is convienient 

### User Stories:
As a FIRST TIME user of the site I want to be able to:
* Intuitively and easily navigate the site to find content.
* Respond with my RSVP.
* Be able to establish the particulars and timings of the vow renewal.
* Browse the photos of the original Wedding Day.

As a RETURNING user of the site I want to be able to:

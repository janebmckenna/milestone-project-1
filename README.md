### Design Choices

- I envisaged that this site would predominantly be used on Mobile. I made the choice to use bootstrap to facilitate my design and I scaled from Mobile first.

- CSS

When I initally passed the site through the Jigsaw Validator it returned alot of errors originating from bootstrap/java script. I made the decission to test me CSS directly through direct input on the validator. 
One error and one warning was returned when tested through direct input on Jigsaw.

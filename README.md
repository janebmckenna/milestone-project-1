## User Experience UX
***
### Strategy
The goal is to  to provide a simple, intuitive and informative website for the vow renewal of Hannah and Ashley. Which guests will navigate easily to respond to their invitation, find useful information and browse images of the original wedding day during the covid 19 pandemic.

### Customers: Hannah and Ashley
Website provides them with a means to communicate the details of their vow renewal, capture RSVPs and share content from the first time around.

### Users: 
Users are close friends and family of Hannah and Ashley they are interested in their story, viewing their pictures, RSVPing to their invite and the details of the day what to expect and what accomodation is convienient 

### User Stories:
As a FIRST TIME user of the site I want to be able to:
* Intuitively and easily navigate the site to find content.
* Respond with my RSVP.
* Be able to establish the particulars and timings of the vow renewal.
* Browse the photos of the original Wedding Day.

As a RETURNING user of the site I want to be able to:
